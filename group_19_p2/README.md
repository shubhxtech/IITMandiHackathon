# Tongue Analysis API

## Overview

The Tongue Analysis API provides advanced tongue health analysis capabilities through computer vision and machine learning. This FastAPI-based service detects and analyzes various tongue characteristics including:

- Tongue segmentation
- White coating detection
- Papillae analysis
- Crack detection
- Jaggedness measurement
- Comprehensive health scoring

The system leverages state-of-the-art AI models including Segment Anything Model (SAM) and custom detection algorithms to provide quantitative metrics for tongue diagnosis.

## Features

- **Tongue Segmentation**: Accurately isolates the tongue area from images using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- **White Coating Analysis**: Detects and quantifies white coating percentage on the tongue surface
- **Papillae Detection**: Identifies, counts, and analyzes tongue papillae characteristics
- **Crack Detection**: Advanced detection and scoring of tongue cracks
- **Jaggedness Analysis**: Measures tongue edge irregularities
- **Health Scoring**: Provides nutrition and mantle health scores based on tongue characteristics
- **Summary Generation**: AI-generated summary of tongue health findings using Gemini API
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat functionality for discussing health concerns

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for optimal performance)
- SAM model checkpoint (`sam_vit_h.pth`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhxtech/HealthLingue.git
   cd HealthLingue
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the SAM model checkpoint:
   ```bash
   # Download from https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
   # Rename to sam_vit_h.pth and place in the project root directory
   ```

4. Create output directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p output
   ```

## Running the API Server

Start the API server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn FastApiServer:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
